        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who grew up surrounded by computers. My dad would build computers from scratch for friends as a hobby, and my curiosity for technolgy has always been there. Studying to be a web developer is my big step into finally exploring that curiousity.</p>
        <p>I've worked in the Investment Management space for a little under 5 years all while working in the robo-advisor space. Seeing the importance of a good flowing online application is important for my company made me want to just dive right in to find a way to help.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>React</li>
          <li>Node JS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d like to work for my current company to help improve their online presence as well as web applications for clients. Alternatively if I ever got the opportunity to work for either Riot Games, or Twitch my inner gamer would bounce off the walls.</p>
